# webdriverbots
Bots that I made with selenium webdriver based in UI automation.

Whatsapp Web and Discord bots included.

You will need the latest version of python (current python version 3.8.3).

You will need the selenium library for python. 

Once you install python, go to your console and type: 

$pip install selenium Then you will need the webdriver. 

The software uses the chrome driver, you can install it on: 

https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads (install the one associated to your chrome version) 

Extract and paste it on 

Linux: /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin 

Windows: \AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32 

You can use other webdriver but then you will need to change it on the code. Enjoy.
